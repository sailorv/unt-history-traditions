# UNT History and Traditions
## About
Ahead of the launch of the University of North Texas' 130 year anniversary campaign, I built the UNT History and Traditions website in Drupal 8.

Because the University's Drupal base theme and primary Drupal distribution are built on D7, I wanted to use a small site as a test case for reengineering the University theme in Drupal 8 and Symfony's <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig</a>.

The live, official site that was launched after this pilot project is <a href="http://traditions.unt.edu">http://traditions.unt.edu</a>.

## Other information
Along with Drupal 8, this website uses the following contributed Drupal modules:
* Paragraphs
* Pathauto
* Ctools
* Token
